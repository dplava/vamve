   <dcterms:description>Letter from George T. Devereux of Devereux and Co. to Ann Pamela Cunningham, ca. June 1860. Philadelphia. Her pain over his nonfullfillment of his obligation to Mr. Mitchell. Assents to her paying the debt and deducting it, but would prefer to pay it himself out of August advance. Cannot talk to her about other matter until he talks to his brother. Great anxieties to which the publication of Record has subjected him although he realizes its great services to Association. Must talk over with brother the statement she sent. If Mount Vernon Record is crushed, their hopes for future go with it, too.</dcterms:description>
