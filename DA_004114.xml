   <dcterms:description>Alexander Hamilton writes to Colonel John Fitzgerald, while he waits for the Treaty of Paris to arrive. He writes "The enclosed letter is for Mr. Bowman who married Mrs. Cattle. I am told he is at Alexandria which makes me trouble you with the letter. Should he have left that place for South Carolina, I will thank you to forward it to him. No definitive treaty yet arrived nor any thing else of importance new. I write in Congress..." A cessation of hostilities had been proclaimed by the British in February and by Congress in April. The provisional peace treaty, negotiated in Paris, was ratified by Congress on April 15, but a long delay ensued before the signing of the final treaty in Paris, 1783 September 3. Both Hamilton and Fitzgerald served as aides-de-camp to Washington during the Revolution. Autograph letter signed, 1 page with integral address panel. </dcterms:description>
