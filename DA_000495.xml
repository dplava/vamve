   <dcterms:description>Tobias Lear's copy of an explanatory letter from him to John Adams in which he elaborated on Martha Washington's December 31, 1799 letter he wrote on behalf of her. In the letter he explains, "After a severe struggle, Mrs. Washington has yielded to the request made by Congress, as you will find from her letter. Having passed upwards of forty years with the Partner of her Heart, it required more than common fortitude to consent to an act which, possibly, might deprive her of almost the only consolation she has had since his decease - namely, that her remains would be deposited in the same tomb with his." Autograph letter signed, 2 pages. Related manuscript - see RM-1212.001 </dcterms:description>
