   <dcterms:description>Shows territorial possessions in North America after the Treaty of Paris. Includes the satirical "Theodolite's letter to the Botcher's Club in Monmouth Street." The open letter appears to praise the treaty and the 3rd Earl of Bute, who worked on the treaty, while actually pointing out the weaknesses of the territory gained. Theodolite, a scientific instrument used in surveying, likely represented Bute, who collected such instruments. Botchers were menders such as tailor and cobblers, and Monmouth Street was known for its second-hand shops. The letter was thus from Bute to those with mercantile interests or low connections as Bute?s peers disapproved of him and the treaty. The true author of the letter was likely Sayer or a colleague with similar political sentiments.</dcterms:description>
