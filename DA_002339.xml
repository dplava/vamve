   <dcterms:title>Letter, Jane C. Washington to John Augustine Washington III, 1855 April 9</dcterms:title>

   <dcterms:description>Jane writes to her son from Blakeley that an enslaved man named George has died. "He was very much reduced, not being able for some time to retain any nourishment. He was delirious, but never violent or ungovernable: fancying he saw lovely angel children near him - and when I read to him, was calm, &amp; apparently pleased, tho' he seldom spoke." She adds, "I shall miss him very much, he was a faithful and affectionate servant - and in traveling watchful and attentive to my comfort." She had intended to send for Reverend Charles E. Ambler of Zion Episcopal Church in Charles Town for George's funeral, but "Mary Jane preferred 'Solomon,'" a Baptist preacher. Autograph letter signed "Jean C. Washington," 3 pages. </dcterms:description>
