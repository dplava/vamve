   <dcterms:title>Letter, Jared Sparks to John A. Washington III, 1844 June 5</dcterms:title>

   <dcterms:description>Letter from historian and George Washington biographer Jared Sparks of Cambridge, Massachusetts to John Augustine Washington III proposing he write a life of Lawrence Washington. Sparks writes "I was already acquainted with the principal incidents in the life of Lawrence Washington, and although the papers would not seem to furnish materials for a biography of much extent, yet I think a Life of moderate length might be written, which would be interesting and fill a proper space in the 'Library of American Biography.' If you will forward me the papers, I will do the best that I can with them." Sparks says George Washington's papers were sent to him in "one of the packets sailing from Alexandria to Boston." He directs that the papers be put in a box and be addressed to him, care of Little &amp; Brown, Booksellers, Boston. Sparks specifies that John Augustine should put all the papers into the box without removing any, because even seemingly unimportant documents are of use to the historian. Sparks promises to return all the papers in the same condition in which they were received. Sparks requests John Augustine to send him the portrait of Lawrence Washington from Mount Vernon so that an engraving can be made for the book. As assurance that the portrait will be returned safely, Sparks mentions how Mr. Custis sent the portrait of Martha Washington from Arlington that now appears in one of the volumes of Washington's Writings. Autograph letter signed, seal, 4 pages. </dcterms:description>
