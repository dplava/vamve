   <dcterms:description>Letter to Frances Lewis Butler from her sister and mother. Mary Eliza Angela Lewis, also nicknamed 'Tiffin,' writes to her sister about her recent trip to Washington, D. C. where she witnessed debates in the Senate and House. Confesses that she also attended a '[Henry] Clay meeting' and rather enjoyed it. Reports that members from the meeting later visited Mount Vernon and Mr. Bradford of Virginia delivered an excellent and appropriate address at the tomb. Mentions other family members. Nelly adds her own letter to the latter part of the document, commenting on 'Sonny's' portrait [by Chapman] and the response of a visitor as the "best likeness of a child he ever saw." It is the greatest ornament in their parlor. Writes about the weather, picking wild strawberries and various family members as well as upcoming travel plans. Autograph letter signed, 4 pages. Postmarked Alexandria, May 28. </dcterms:description>
