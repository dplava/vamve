   <dcterms:description>Copy of a statement by John West Jr., Sheriff of Fairfax Co., dated May 20, 1760, reporting the sale, on behalf of the commissioners of the Clifton tract, to George Washington, the highest bidder, for the sum of Â£1210. This purchase was George Washington's first addition to his Mount Vernon plantation. On the verso is a copy of the commissioners' report of the sale of the Clifton property and their acknowledgment of receipt of the money. Analysis of the handwriting has led experts to believe this copy was transcribed by George Washington.  Autograph document consisting of one page with text on recto and verso. The page has been silked and the silking is slightly larger than the document and 1/2 inch of the silking at the left endge has been folded under against the verso of the document. Large watermark, center of sheet. Similar to Gravell, Foreign Watermarks 21. As a result of silking, the watermark is extremely difficult to make out.</dcterms:description>
