   <dcterms:description>Letter from John Augustine Washington III to Ann Pamela Cunningham, March 6, 1858. Discusses the family vault, the most important matter in Mount Vernon purchase terms. The problems involved in selling to the state or to an individual. Alterations in the vault contemplated and ways of securing permanent preservation. Terms of payment, cash and securities offered, amount and time of payments. Mr. Yancey and Miss Cunningham suggest initial payment of 70 or 80 thousand dollars and the rest in one to three years. Important to have conditions exactly recorded and such that Association can meet its obligations. Contributions up to $5000 may be paid as received to lessen Association's interest on payments due. Suggests creating an act of incorporation before signing the contract. Asks for her ideas of a contract for the procedure of sale so as to avoid misunderstandings when the final document is drawn.</dcterms:description>
