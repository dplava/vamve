   <dcterms:description>When George William Fairfax left Virginia for England in 1773, he gave George Washington power of attorney to manage his business affairs in America. Craven Peyton, who lived in Loudon County, began acting as Fairfax's land agent in that area, collecting rents and having surveys made of Fairfax's properties. Peyton recorded the financial transactions involved in these duties and sent them to Washington, who possibly forwarded the originals to Fairfax and transcribed copies, such as this, for his own records. This account was of particular interest to Washington because it records that on April 26, 1774, he received £277.19.2 ¼ in cash on behalf of Fairfax. It also states that Peyton paid George's cousin Lund Washington £52 intended for Fairfax. Autograph document signed, 1 page, in hand of George Washington., docketed "Copy of Mr. Craven Peytons Acct. Currd. 26 April 1774, since leaving Virginia", silked, watermark (armed woman encircled, and a crown).</dcterms:description>
