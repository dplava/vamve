   <dcterms:description>A list noting the fourteen men and three women who escaped on the H.M.S. Savage was compiled by Lund Washington. The runways included: Peter, Lewis and Frank, all described as "old," Frederick, forty-five years old and an overseer, Gunner a brickmaker who was in his mid-forties, Harry a "Horseler" around forty years old, Tom, and Sambo who were both twenty and described as "stout and Healthy." In addition were: Thomas a seventeen year old house servant, Peter who was fifteen years old, Stephen a twenty year old cooper, twenty-five year old James, Watty (or Wally) a twenty year old weaver, Daniel who was nineteen years old, Lucy who was twenty, Esther who was eighteen, and Deborah who was sixteen years old. Seven of the individuals who escaped the plantation on the British ship—Frederick, Frank, Gunner, Sambo, Thomas, Lucy, and Esther—were eventually returned to Mount Vernon at some point after the siege at Yorktown in the fall of 1781.</dcterms:description>
