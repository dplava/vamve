   <dcterms:description>Martha Washington writes from Philadelphia to her niece Fanny Bassett at Mount Vernon. Mrs. Washington recounts the recent illness and death of Mrs. Tobias Lear, wife of Washington's personal Secretary, and close friend, and how the event had saddened the presidential household. She is pleased that Fanny has had her room white washed and expresses her desire to have Frank white wash the Kitchen and his room in the seller (cellar) as well as him continually keeping things in order for Mrs. Washington's return some time next month.  Other topics include prized gold thread, an unpaid bill to Mr. Lewis for silk, a report by Austin that the Bacon was all spoiled in the smoke house, tranporting lockets by way of a gentleman going to Alexandria, shoes being sent to Mr. Porter for Fanny and cutting and sewing clothes for the enslaved workers.
