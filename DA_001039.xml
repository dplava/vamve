   <dcterms:description>On the subject of George Washington's resignation -- "Regard for you and Anxiety for the wellfare of our common Country have determined me to submit to your Consideration the Thoughts which have occured to me on this Subject, and which I think it would be inconsistent with My Friendship for you to withhold." -- "I well know your invincible Diffidence and your Sensibility with respect to public Opinion ... Be assured that a great Deal of the well earned Popularity that you are now in Possession of will be torn from you by the Envious and Malignant should you follow the bent of your Inclinations ... The Antifederalist would use it as an Argument for disolving the Union and would urge that you from Experience, had found the present system a bad one, and had, artfully, withdrawn from it that you might not be crushed under its Ruins." -- altho others may be capable, the lack of confidence in them would be fatal -- "At this time you are the only Man in America that dares to do right on all public Occasions." -- " ... your very figure is calculated to inspire Respect and Confidence in the People whose simple good Sense associates the noblest qualities of mind with the heroic Form when it is embellished by such remarkable hints of Mildness and calm Benevolence..." -- Questions whether he really would be as happy in retirement as doing good for his country. Autograph letter initial signed, 7 pages. draft, docketed, watermark (J.W.).</dcterms:description>
