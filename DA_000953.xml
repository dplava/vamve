   <dcterms:description>Letter from S.W. Tiffey, secretary, to Ann Pamela Cunningham, December 13, 1869. Anxious to hear from the Regent as it has been weeks since a letter from her was received.  Mrs. Mitchell was expected,  but did not come and they have received no word.  "Mrs. Judge Merrick" and friends called with Mrs. Yulee as her guest. The cornice for the Lafayette Room is black walnut with gilt stars.  Mr. Sykes paid the insurance premium in Alexandria.  Mrs. Ritchie's story has been appearing in the newspaper. The Tomb has been cleaned and wreaths placed there on the anniversary of Washington's death.There are few visitors.  She receives the Regent's letter on 14th.</dcterms:description>
